##Introduction 
Game of Thrones Info-Center is a project I was really excited about doing, especially since I like many others am totally in love with everything Game of Thrones. This was done on Ruby on Rails using PostgresSQL for my database.

###User Story
User will be able to search for a GoT character info will be rendered right below.

User will be able to create a special GoT character and add it the GoT world.

### Technologies Used 
Built on Ruby on Rails with heavy use of JavaScript, PostgresSQL for the database and styled with Bootstrap, along with adding my own styling flair. 

All Game of Thrones data was pulled from the "Fire and Ice API".
